# Advanced Firewall Configurations: ufw in Kali Linux/Ubuntu

## Theoretical Knowledge

The Uncomplicated Firewall (ufw) is a user-friendly frontend for managing netfilter, the Linux kernel firewall. It's designed to be easy to use while providing powerful firewall capabilities.

Key concepts:
- Stateful vs. Stateless firewalls
- Default policies
- Rule precedence
- Application profiles

### Practical Applications in Cybersecurity

- Network segmentation
- Access control
- Protection against unauthorized access
- Logging and monitoring of network traffic

## Hands-on Lab Exercises

### Lab 1: Basic ufw Configuration

1. Install ufw (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install ufw
   ```

2. Check ufw status:
   ```bash
   sudo ufw status
   ```

3. Enable ufw:
   ```bash
   sudo ufw enable
   ```

4. Set default policies:
   ```bash
   sudo ufw default deny incoming
   sudo ufw default allow outgoing
   ```

5. Allow SSH access:
   ```bash
   sudo ufw allow ssh
   ```

6. Verify the rules:
   ```bash
   sudo ufw status verbose
   ```

### Lab 2: Advanced Rule Configuration

1. Allow specific port ranges:
   ```bash
   sudo ufw allow 5000:5005/tcp
   ```

2. Allow traffic from a specific IP address:
   ```bash
   sudo ufw allow from 192.168.1.100
   ```

3. Allow traffic to a specific network interface:
   ```bash
   sudo ufw allow in on eth0 to any port 80
   ```

4. Deny traffic from a subnet:
   ```bash
   sudo ufw deny from 10.0.0.0/24
   ```

5. Set up rate limiting for SSH:
   ```bash
   sudo ufw limit ssh
   ```

### Lab 3: Working with Application Profiles

1. List available application profiles:
   ```bash
   sudo ufw app list
   ```

2. Allow an application profile:
   ```bash
   sudo ufw allow 'Apache Full'
   ```

3. Create a custom application profile:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/ufw/applications.d/myapp
   ```
   Add the following content:
   ```
   [MyApp]
   title=My Custom Application
   description=Open ports for my application
   ports=8080/tcp|8081/udp
   ```

4. Update ufw:
   ```bash
   sudo ufw app update MyApp
   ```

5. Allow the custom application:
   ```bash
   sudo ufw allow 'MyApp'
   ```

### Lab 4: Logging and Monitoring

1. Enable logging:
   ```bash
   sudo ufw logging on
   ```

2. Set logging level:
   ```bash
   sudo ufw logging medium
   ```

3. View logs:
   ```bash
   sudo tail -f /var/log/ufw.log
   ```

4. Use `iptables` to view detailed rule information:
   ```bash
   sudo iptables -L -n -v
   ```

## Real-world Scenario: Securing a Web Server

A small business is setting up a new web server that needs to be accessible from the internet while maintaining security. They decide to use ufw to configure their firewall.

Solution:
1. Set default policies:
   ```bash
   sudo ufw default deny incoming
   sudo ufw default allow outgoing
   ```

2. Allow SSH access (for remote administration):
   ```bash
   sudo ufw limit ssh
   ```

3. Allow HTTP and HTTPS traffic:
   ```bash
   sudo ufw allow 'Apache Full'
   ```

4. Allow FTP for file uploads (if necessary):
   ```bash
   sudo ufw allow ftp
   ```

5. Deny access from a known malicious IP range:
   ```bash
   sudo ufw deny from 203.0.113.0/24
   ```

6. Enable logging for monitoring:
   ```bash
   sudo ufw logging on
   ```

7. Enable the firewall:
   ```bash
   sudo ufw enable
   ```

Result: The web server is now protected against unauthorized access while allowing legitimate traffic. The rate limiting on SSH helps prevent brute-force attacks, and logging enables the business to monitor for potential security issues.
