# Docker Security Best Practices

## 1. Introduction
- Brief overview of Docker and its role in modern software development
- Importance of Docker security in the DevSecOps pipeline

## 2. Securing the Docker Daemon

### Theoretical Knowledge
- Explanation of the Docker daemon and its role
- Potential security risks associated with an unsecured Docker daemon

### Practical Applications
- Configuring TLS for Docker daemon communication
- Implementing user namespace remapping
- Setting up Docker daemon firewall rules

### Hands-on Lab Exercise
- Set up a secure Docker daemon configuration
  - Generate TLS certificates
  - Configure Docker to use TLS
  - Test secure communication with the Docker client

### Real-world Scenario
- Case study: Company X's Docker daemon compromise and lessons learned

## 3. Image Vulnerability Scanning

### Theoretical Knowledge
- Importance of scanning Docker images for vulnerabilities
- Common vulnerabilities found in Docker images

### Practical Applications
- Overview of popular image scanning tools (e.g., Trivy, Clair, Anchore)
- Integrating image scanning into CI/CD pipelines

### Hands-on Lab Exercise
- Implement Trivy for Docker image scanning
  - Install Trivy
  - Scan a sample Docker image
  - Interpret and address found vulnerabilities

### Real-world Scenario
- Analysis of a recent vulnerability found in a popular Docker image

## 4. Container Isolation Techniques

### Theoretical Knowledge
- Principles of container isolation
- Docker's default isolation mechanisms

### Practical Applications
- Implementing secure computing (seccomp) profiles
- Using AppArmor or SELinux for enhanced isolation
- Utilizing Docker's --security-opt flags

### Hands-on Lab Exercise
- Create and apply a custom seccomp profile
  - Write a seccomp profile JSON file
  - Apply the profile to a running container
  - Test the effectiveness of the profile

### Real-world Scenario
- Examination of a container escape vulnerability and how proper isolation could have prevented it

## 5. Docker Content Trust and Image Signing

### Theoretical Knowledge
- Explanation of Docker Content Trust (DCT)
- Importance of image signing in maintaining a secure supply chain

### Practical Applications
- Setting up and using Docker Content Trust
- Implementing image signing in a development workflow

### Hands-on Lab Exercise
- Enable and use Docker Content Trust
  - Generate signing keys
  - Sign a Docker image
  - Push and pull signed images

### Real-world Scenario
- Case study: How image signing prevented a supply chain attack in Company Y
