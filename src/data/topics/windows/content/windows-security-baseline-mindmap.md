- **Windows Security Baselines**
  - **Theoretical Explanation**
    - Definition: Predefined security settings
    - Purpose: Consistent security across systems
    - Benefits:
      - Consistency
      - Compliance (GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS)
      - Reduced attack surface
      - Ease of deployment
  - **Key Concepts**
    - **Group Policy Objects (GPOs)**
      - Used for domain-wide security enforcement
      - Centralized management
    - **Local Security Policy**
      - For standalone systems
      - Accessed via `secpol.msc`
    - **Security Compliance Toolkit (SCT)**
      - Pre-configured baselines
      - Importable into GPOs
    - **Common Security Settings**
      - Password Policies
        - Minimum password length
        - Complexity requirements
        - Password expiration
      - Account Lockout Policies
        - Lockout threshold
        - Reset counter
      - Audit Policies
        - File system auditing
        - Logon attempts
      - Windows Defender & Antivirus
      - Firewall Configuration
  - **Practical Example**
    - Hands-On Lab Exercise
      - Apply baseline using Local Security Policy
      - Configure:
        - Password policies
        - Account lockout policies
        - Auditing
      - Verify changes with `gpupdate /force`
  - **Discussion Questions**
    - Importance of password complexity
    - Risks of low account lockout thresholds
    - Role of auditing in incident response
    - Applying baselines in large environments
